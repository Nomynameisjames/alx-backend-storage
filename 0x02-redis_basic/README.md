					Introduction:
Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
This repository aims to provide some basic examples on how to use Redis for basic operations and as a simple cache.

					Basic Operations:
The basic operations that can be performed using Redis include setting and retrieving data, setting expiration times,
incrementing and decrementing values, and deleting keys. Redis is a key-value store and data is stored using key-value pairs.

					Simple Cache:
Redis can also be used as a simple cache to store frequently accessed data in memory.
Caching can help to improve application performance by reducing the time required to fetch data from disk or a remote database.

To use Redis as a simple cache, you can set an expiration time on the cached data, so that it is automatically deleted after a set period.
This helps to ensure that the cache does not become stale and that the data is always fresh.

					Examples:
This repository contains examples on how to use Redis for basic operations and as a simple cache.
The examples are written in Python and use the Redis-py library.

					Getting Started:
To get started with Redis, you will need to install Redis on your system and have a Redis server running.
You will also need to install the Redis-py library.

```$ sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
$ pip3 install redis
$ sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf```

after which you can start the redis server by running the command
```service redis-server start```

invoke the redis CLI by hitting the command
```redis-cli```

test using

```PING```

Once you have installed Redis and Redis-py, you can clone this repository and run the examples to learn how to use Redis for basic operations and as a simple cache.
